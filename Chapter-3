@ Write a Log Package

Write ahead log(WAL), transaction logs, commit logs - heart of storage engines, message queues,
version control, replication and consensus algorithms

Database devs use WAL for replication. Instead of writing logs to disk, they write over network
to its replicas and they eventually end up with same state. 

We write to active segment and archive old segments.
Each segment has a store and an index file. Store file has record data (we append records here)
Index file indexes each record in store file. Index files are small enough to store as memory-mapped files.

@ Build a Log

Record - the data stored in our log.
Store - the file we store records in.
Index - the file we store index entries in.
Segment - the abstraction that ties a store and an index together.
Log - the abstraction that ties all the segments together.
